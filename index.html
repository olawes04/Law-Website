    <h1>Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988</h1>
    <h2>What is the purpose of the CDPA?</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>It exists to protect the intellectual property (ip) of a person or organisation.</li>
        <li>This is enforced by making it illegal to copy the ip of a person or organisation, people who ignore this can face charges of piracy and copyright infringement depending on the offence</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What works can be copyrighted?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Literary works, such as books</li>
        <li>General artistic works such as buildings, photos, paintings... Even the colour of the lights on the Eiffel Tower</li>
        <li>Music and sound recording</li>
        <li>Broadcasts, this includes videos and radio</li>
        <li>However almost anything made before the 1st of June 1957 isn't copyrighted (in the UK)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How does this effect the normal consumer and you?</h3>
    <p>The first and most obvious effect is that most of what you own is copyrighted by one person or another, the phone or monitor you're watching this on is copyrighted by the company that made it, the chair you're sitting on, the music and videos you watch, almost everything is copyrighted.</p>
    <p>This means that you need to be aware of what you can and can't do, the easiest way to tell if you can do something is if it will make money? If it will them you will likely get a takedown from the IP holder but personal projects and certain other things can be considered fair use and thus can be made without fear (This doesn't apply at all in Japan as they don't have fair use at all)</p>

    <p><dfn>Fair Use:</dfn> there is an exception to copyright that permits people to use limited amounts of copyright material without the ownerâ€™s permission for the purpose of parody, caricature or pastiche.

    <p>Another very important and current concern with copyright is <em>AI</em> specifically generative "Artificial Intelligence". Generative AI is commonly used to make pictures and images, this is done by scraping large volumes of images of the internet and running them through it to make an algorithmn, when a request comes in the AI generates "Static" over the image and tries to "reconstruct" the original IP image, this creates a new image which isn't copyrighted in theory. However there is a large amount of debate over whether this is legal at all because the training data was used without permission from the creators and the new image was created using pre-existing copyrighted work. There is currently a court case against the AI Midjourney (in the US) that will determine the US' stance on the matter and provide grounds for other countries to make their own legislation.
    </p>
    <p>Text based generative AI has also encountered legal trouble, when asked to write an essay about a niche subject the AI has a tendency use copyrighted work and data without citing its sources or making any mention of using another author's content. Additionally the AIs are known to "hallucinate" making up information, this can lead to problems if information is copied without checking its validity, see Steven A Schwartz, where ChatGPT made up legal cases to satisfy his request leading to fake cases being presented in court.</p>
    <h4>How long does copyright last?</h4>
    <p>Books and other literary works are protected when they are original and have unique situations, but in general copyright lasts for 70 years after the death of the author in the UK, the US has other rules which has allowed for works such as Steamboat Willie to enter the public domain almost a century after its creation.</p>
